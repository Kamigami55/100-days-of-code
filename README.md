Day1 of #100DaysOfCode

üòé Watched an awesome video from @fireship_dev about @remotion_dev

üòé Remotion is a cool library for making videos (mp4!) from #React code

üòé Kickstarted the Remotion starter project and learned how the video is made

https://youtu.be/deg8bOoziaE

The latest Remotion intro video from @fireship_dev, must watch üëÄ

https://remotion.dev

Remotion homepage, we can learn how to make videos in React from here

Day2 of #100DaysOfCode

üí°Integrate @ProductHunt #graphql API to fetch everyday featured products

üí°Try some zx script (write shell script in #javascript)

Can you guess what I am trying to build? I will combine these with Remotion I learned yesterday!

Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode 

ü§ü Learned @prisma, a great ORM works perfect with #TypeScript 

ü§ü Also tried its Prisma Cloud as database studio

ü§ü Underlying I used PlanetScale @planetscaledata as DB provider (MySQL)

Now I have a new free DB tech stack for side projects!

Although it takes me some time to figure out how to sync DB connection and schema between Prisma, PlanetScale, GitHub new commit, local

Creating a new project in Prisma Cloud connected with PlanetScale always failed, but actually it succeeded‚Ä¶, both new project and DB were created, I have to refresh myself to see my project is there, wired‚Ä¶

Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode

For side project:

Refined my #zx script for fetching #producthunt featured posts, some Date() stuff, and write JSON file

For work:

Keep writing unit tests for React components, hooks, and utility functions using #Jest and #ReactTestingLibrary

Current zx script:

Tried #Polacode for taking screenshot (a #VSCode extension)

![img](https://i.imgur.com/1AcKPk9.jpg)

The hardest part of writing unit tests for @nextjs project using @fbjest & @TestingLib is mocking Next.js stuff...,

Still struggling to mock publicRuntimeConfig and be able to control it in different test case

Day 5 of #100DaysOfCode

I've created my first @alfredapp workflow: Clone Project

This can do the following things:

1Ô∏è‚É£ git clone a project from some URL

2Ô∏è‚É£ open project in VSCode @code

3Ô∏è‚É£ open project in Fork @git_fork

It will save lots of keystrokes in my everyday workflow

Although my original plan tonight is to finish another tiny project...

I ended up tweaking my dev workflow and that project remains untouched :)
