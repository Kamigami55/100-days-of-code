Day1 of #100DaysOfCode

😎 Watched an awesome video from @fireship_dev about @remotion_dev

😎 Remotion is a cool library for making videos (mp4!) from #React code

😎 Kickstarted the Remotion starter project and learned how the video is made

The latest Remotion intro video from @fireship_dev, must watch 👀

https://remotion.dev

Remotion homepage, we can learn how to make videos in React from here

Day2 of #100DaysOfCode

💡Integrate @ProductHunt #graphql API to fetch everyday featured products

💡Try some zx script (write shell script in #javascript)

Can you guess what I am trying to build? I will combine these with Remotion I learned yesterday!

Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode 

🤟 Learned @prisma, a great ORM works perfect with #TypeScript 

🤟 Also tried its Prisma Cloud as database studio

🤟 Underlying I used PlanetScale @planetscaledata as DB provider (MySQL)

Now I have a new free DB tech stack for side projects!

Although it takes me some time to figure out how to sync DB connection and schema between Prisma, PlanetScale, GitHub new commit, local

Creating a new project in Prisma Cloud connected with PlanetScale always failed, but actually it succeeded…, both new project and DB were created, I have to refresh myself to see my project is there, wired…

Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode

For side project:

Refined my #zx script for fetching #producthunt featured posts, some Date() stuff, and write JSON file

For work:

Keep writing unit tests for React components, hooks, and utility functions using #Jest and #ReactTestingLibrary

Current zx script:

Tried #Polacode for taking screenshot (a #VSCode extension)

![img](https://i.imgur.com/1AcKPk9.jpg)

The hardest part of writing unit tests for @nextjs project using @fbjest & @TestingLib is mocking Next.js stuff...,

Still struggling to mock publicRuntimeConfig and be able to control it in different test case

Day 5 of #100DaysOfCode

I've created my first @alfredapp workflow: Clone Project

This can do the following things:

1️⃣ git clone a project from some URL

2️⃣ open project in VSCode @code

3️⃣ open project in Fork @git_fork

It will save lots of keystrokes in my everyday workflow

Although my original plan tonight is to finish another tiny project...

I ended up tweaking my dev workflow and that project remains untouched :)

#100DaysOfCode Day6

I just published an npm package `eslint-config-eason` for setting up my own #Eslint, #Prettier config

Things I learned:

- Publish npm package
- Maintain package sem ver
- Install local npm package
- Deeper Eslint, Prettier understanding

![code snippet about eslint-config-eason](https://i.imgur.com/l7bZGMH.jpg)

NPM package:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-eason

Basic project files are cloned from @wesbos's own config (huge thanks!)

https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos

原理參考自 @pjchender 大大的好文，去年就看到了，現在終於有機會實踐個，不然每次開新專案都很痛苦

#100DaysOfCode Day 8

Just installed @tailwindcss to my @remotion_dev and added some style to my video!

Let me add some animation tomorrow

Also noticed Remotion still doesn't work with TailwindCSS@v3, maybe I can give it a try and have some contribution
