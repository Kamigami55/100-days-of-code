## Day 3: March 08, 2022

Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode 
ü§ü Learned @prisma, a great ORM works perfect with #TypeScript 
ü§ü Also tried its Prisma Cloud as database studio
ü§ü Underlying I used PlanetScale @planetscaledata as DB provider (MySQL)
Now I have a new free DB tech stack for side projects!

Although it takes me some time to figure out how to sync DB connection and schema between Prisma, PlanetScale, GitHub new commit, local

Creating a new project in Prisma Cloud connected with PlanetScale always failed, but actually it succeeded‚Ä¶, both new project and DB were created, I have to refresh myself to see my project is there, wired‚Ä¶

## Day 4: March 09, 2022

Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode

For side project:
Refined my #zx script for fetching #producthunt featured posts, some Date() stuff, and write JSON file

For work:
Keep writing unit tests for React components, hooks, and utility functions using #Jest and #ReactTestingLibrary

Current zx script:
Tried #Polacode for taking screenshot (a #VSCode extension)

The hardest part of writing unit tests for @nextjs project using @fbjest & @TestingLib is mocking Next.js stuff...,

Still struggling to mock publicRuntimeConfig and be able to control it in different test case

## Day 5: March 12, 2022

Day 5 of #100DaysOfCode

I've created my first @alfredapp workflow: Clone Project

This can do the following things:
1Ô∏è‚É£ git clone a project from some URL
2Ô∏è‚É£ open project in VSCode @code
3Ô∏è‚É£ open project in Fork @git_fork

It will save lots of keystrokes in my everyday workflow

Although my original plan tonight is to finish another tiny project...

I ended up tweaking my dev workflow and that project remains untouched :)
